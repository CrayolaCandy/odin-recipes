    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> While you can use many types of noodles to make 
        lucky noodles (also called longevity or long life noodles), 
        Mama uses wonton noodles. They are thin egg-based 
        noodles that are often eaten dry or in soups with proteins, 
        greens, and wontons. The staple can be found in many 
        restaurants and food stalls serving Cantonese-style Chinese 
        cuisine, particularly in southern China, Hong Kong, 
        Thailand, and Singapore. </p>
    <p>My family enjoys the noodles with wontons, blanched bok 
        choy or gai lan (Chinese broccoli), and a variety of 
        proteins (pork, chicken, and duck). While Mama makes a big 
        batch of barbecued char siu pork for Chinese New Year, she 
        gets roasted ducks from a local restaurant and heads to Costco 
        for rotisserie chickens and bags of Bibigo chicken and cabbage 
        mini wontons.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound package of fresh wonton noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fried garlic oil or olive oil</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Blanched greens (such as bok choy or broccoli)</li>
        <li>Cooked frozen wontons</li>
        <li>Proteins of your choice (such as sliced chicken, char siu pork, or duck)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil (at least 2 quarts) on high heat.</li>
        <li>Unravel and loosen the noodles gently on a cutting board or plate. Be careful not to break them so they stay as long as possible.</li>
        <li>While the water is boiling, let the noodles cook for about 30 seconds, stirring them continuously and carefully with a pair of chopsticks or kitchen tongs.</li>
        <li>Strain the noodles, then transfer them to a bowl of cold water and swirl them around.</li>
        <li>Strain the strands again and transfer them to a large bowl. Season the noodles with the oil, soy sauce, and sugar and toss them gently.</li>
        <li>Serve the noodles with sliced proteins, wontons, and greens.</li>
    </ol>
